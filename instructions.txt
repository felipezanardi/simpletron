How to add your code to a file:
Access the Simpletron folder where the program's file is located (simpletron.c).
In that folder, look for the file named 'scripts.txt', and insert the code
you want there.
Save and execute.

The 'scripts.txt' file already comes with a code that receives two values and
returns the greater between them.

To execute, just compile and execute the 'simpletron.c' file.
Note: The "scripts.txt' file must be in the same directory as the executable for the program to find it.
